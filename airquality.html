                <p>On an idyllic-looking stretch of Milwaukee Avenue in Highland Park, couples are sitting on their porches, bikers are running stop signs, and families are walking their dogs. To the naked eye, the block looks untouched by the Los Angeles fires that ravaged much of the surrounding neighborhoods in January 2025. However, there is something hanging invisibly in the air that has prevented Reda Rountree and her family from returning to their home of almost 20 years.</p>

                <figure>

                </figure>

                <p>While Highland Park was just across the freeway from the mandatory evacuation zone for the Eaton fire, Rountree and her family still evacuated their home on January 7.</p>

                <p>“I woke up and there was the smell of smoke,” said Ket Gill, one of Reda’s twins. “I looked out my window and the sky was orange. It felt like the apocalypse.”</p>

                <p>In a frantic rush, Rountree, her husband, their two kids and four cats, packed their car and fled the neighborhood. Little did Rountree know, that would be the last day she and her family would all wake up in that same house they’d called home since 2006.</p>

                <p>While most people on her old street have returned to their homes, respiratory complications caused by long Covid have left Rountree particularly sensitive to pollutants lingering in the air, almost a year after the fires.</p>

                <p>“We tried eight times to move me back to our Highland Park neighborhood,” said Rountree. “Every single time, I couldn’t breathe.”</p>

                <p>Rountree is just one of many disabled Angelenos who are facing significant health consequences even months after the fires.</p> 

                <p>“Sometimes you go outside, and it just suffocates you,” said Héctor Ramírez, another Angeleno with long Covid. “This is something that many of us who have developed long Covid are dealing with.”</p>

                <p>Dr. Maryun Merchant, a pulmonologist at UCLA, confirmed that patients with respiratory conditions such as chronic lung disease, asthma, and long Covid have been reporting worse symptoms.</p>

                <p>“We suspect that that may have to do with exposure following the wildfire smoke,” said Dr. Merchant.</p>

                <p>Merchant said that patients who never even had to evacuate have been feeling the effects of the air quality, due to heavy winds and the sheer scale of the fires. Rountree, who now lives in Orange County, has reported feeling the same suffocating feeling she felt in L.A. a few times, even over 30 miles away from her Highland Park home.</p>

                <p>“Someone who may be living 50 miles away … could have had much higher exposures to the toxins,” said Dr. Merchant. “It all depends on where the wind is going.”</p>

                <p>And it’s not just the wind: even bringing household objects from the fire zone into new houses can cause respiratory problems, according to a former resident. Pollutants can stick to surfaces, even months after the fire. Professional treatment and cleaning can be expensive and an out-of-reach luxury for most residents. These pollutants, including lead, asbestos, and benzene can also be absorbed into the soil, and become airborne again when the soil is disturbed — for example by construction; which is now happening all over neighborhoods affected by the fires.</p>

                <p>Rountree and her family now live in northern Orange County, while their Highland Park home stands empty. Rountree is unsure of when they will be able to return. In the months since her displacement, life has gone on around her.</p>

                <p>“I missed so much by not being in L.A. I couldn’t attend my kids’ high school graduation,” said Rountree. “Think about it: to have to miss my own kids’ high school graduation… that’s how sick the air in L.A. is making me.”</p>

                <p>Due to long Covid and POTS, Rountree spends most of her time at home. Before the fires, that meant spending time on a street she’d lived on for nearly two decades, with neighbors and a community she knew and trusted. That same sense of security just does not exist in the same way for her in Orange County.</p>

                <p>“Our neighbors are like family to me, not having them across the street is extremely difficult,” said Rountree.</p>

                <p>People with disabilities are almost twice as likely to be displaced in a natural disaster, and almost four times as likely to never return home after displacement. There are a number of reasons for this, and Reda Rountree and her family are just one of many. But for now, there is no end in sight.</p>

                <p>“I’m here until the air quality improves, or until I physically improve,” said Rountree. “But truthfully, I’m not really holding my breath — no pun intended.”</p>

                <p>While Rountree and others can physically feel the impacts of the air quality, it’s virtually impossible to quantify what is actually in the air, and too early to know for sure how the health impacts will manifest. Dr. Merchant compares the aftermath of the fires with the aftermath of the September 11th attacks in New York City. People with respiratory conditions may be the first to feel the impacts of this pollution, but it is likely affecting everybody, even if they can’t name their symptoms.</p>

                <p>“It’s possible that some patients who perceive themselves as very healthy may be developing some symptoms,” said Dr. Merchant. “It may manifest itself as something else years later.”</p>

                <p>“When something like this happens,” said Rountree, “it happens to disabled people first.”</p>
