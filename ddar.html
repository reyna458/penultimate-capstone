        <div class="first article-body">
            <p>Southern California Edison (SCE), the utility company that provides electricity to the Los Angeles area, abruptly terminated an agreement to provide disabled residents of the fire-prone region with high wattage backup batteries to power their medical devices in the event of a power outage, according to foundation officials.</p>

            <p>SCE terminated its contract with the <a href="https://disabilitydisasteraccess.org/" target="_blank">Disaster Access & Resources (DDAR)</a> program, which is facilitated by the <a href='https://cfilc.org/' target="_blank">Foundation for Independent Living Centers (CFILC)</a>, in October, according to foundation officials, even though more than a year remained. The $4 million contract supported independent living centers in providing wellness checks, emergency transportation, and other emergency services for disabled residents.</p>

            <p>The cancellation of the contract comes as the CEO of the Edison International, SCE’s parent company, announced in a quarterly earnings report that faulty company equipment was the “likely” cause of the Eaton fire, which decimated Altadena in early 2025, causing at least 19 deaths (most of whom were elderly or disabled), destroying more than a thousand structures, and creating environmental conditions that will keep some disabled residents from returning to the area.</p> 

            <p>Without the agreement, foundation officials say SCE will provide backup batteries upon request and only after a power outage,
            “Our program would deliver a battery prior to a power shutoff,” Serra Rea, program manager for DDAR, said. “That way when the power does go out, you’re not scrambling.”</p>

            <p>Rea and CFILC’s Communications and Strategic Partnerships manager Russell Dawson Rawlings say it can take up to 24 hours for SCE to deliver a backup battery. Those first 24 hours can be crucial for people with disabilities depending on what medical equipment they rely on.</p>

            <p>“For example, an oxygen concentrator. Those are devices where any loss of power, means that a critical life function … is potentially disrupted,” said Rawlings, who himself uses an electric wheelchair that requires power to charge. “That becomes an emergency almost instantaneously. You don’t even have long enough to call SCE.”</p>

            <p>During and after the Eaton fire, independent living centers across Los Angeles were able to offer crucial assistance to people with disabilities. With the contract terminated, some of those same services are now non-operational.</p>

            <p>Elizabeth Lutz, a disabled Angeleno who has been displaced from their home since January due to smoke damage, wrote in a letter to TK, that her independent living center, the Disability Community Resource Center in west Los Angeles, offered some of the only assistance she received post fire.</p>

            <p>“[DCRC] is the only program that consistently sent emails, made check-in phone calls, kept checking on my health,” said Lutz. “[DCRC] gave me a battery so that I could use some of my medical equipment, needed to breathe, even though I am living in my car.”</p>

            <p>The three-year contract was terminated during the second year. A <a href='https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M580/K788/580788967.PDF' target="_blank">report released by SCE</a> said that, because they were now providing batteries after power outages, the partnership with DDAR was superfluous. TK SCE EXPLANATION HERE</p>

            <p>Public safety power shut offs occur when the risk of fire is high, as electrical wires can topple and start fires. It’s believed that an SCE power line is what started the Eaton fire, which ravaged Altadena. After the fires, the sheer destruction of which was fueled by extreme Santa Ana winds, SCE lowered the threshold for when a power shutoff is necessary from 35mph to 25mph of sustained wind.</p>

            <p>Rea, who has been working in disaster response since 2019, and says these power shutoffs have been becoming more frequent. As climate change worsens dry conditions in the region and strengthens winds, fires and power outages will become even more frequent.</p>

            <p>“There is no such thing as fire season,” said Rea. “Fire season is year round now.”</p>

            <p>While SCE may be able to cover some of the services provided by DDAR under the partnership, the community connection is lost. Able-bodied people may be able to stay in their homes in the event of a power outage, but people with disabilities may not be afforded that same privilege. When SCE is unable to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities in their homes, they may relocate them to a hotel, according to Rea and Russell.</p>

            <P>“They do not give them the opportunity to stay independent,” said Rea. <span class="highlight">"Edison is taking their independence away.”</span></p>

            <p>Russell and Rea say that DDAR is better suited to ensure people with disabilities are accommodated fairly while maintaining their independence.</p>

            <p>“The majority of our coordinators are part of the [disabled] community,” said Rea. “We also have disabilities and we understand the disability world a lot better than utility corporate.”</p>
