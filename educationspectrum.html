                <p>Just before 2 p.m. on January 8, 2025, Fox 11 Los Angeles broadcast coverage of the Eaton fire raging through an Aldi in Altadena. The destruction of the supermarket building was captured by a Fox camera crew set up across Lake Avenue in the parking lot of a strip mall containing  a veterinarian’s office, a Kumon tutoring center, and a learning center for people with autism called Education Spectrum.</p>

                <p>Education Spectrum, founded in 1997, offers a variety of support groups for people with autism or other development disabilities, as well as their families.</p>

                <p>Miraculously, the Eaton fire spared the Education Spectrum building, causing only minor roof damage. But the building could not be used for more than six months, leaving a void in a vulnerable community.</p>


                <p>“Socializing is such a difficult skill for people with autism,” said Cathy Gott, the founder of Education Spectrum. “These connections have been years in the making. Without these groups and their instructors, they were very lost.”</p>

                <p>The evacuation of Education Spectrum is but one example of how the L.A. Fires affected people with disabilities. The Eaton fire brought about drastic changes in routine for everyone in Altadena, but changes in routine can be extremely difficult to deal with for people with autism. REPHRASE.</p>

                <p>TKTK EXPERT ON THIS</p>

                <p>“We lost everything,” said Sean Laino, 30, an Education Spectrum client whose family home burned down in the Eaton fire. He also lost contact with the support group he attended at Education Spectrum. “I wasn’t able to meet up with Education Spectrum a lot. I did miss it.”</p>

                <p>After the fire, Education Spectrum’s services briefly moved online, before temporarily relocating meetings to public places, such as malls, ice-skating rinks, and arcades.</p>

                <p>Then, in March, Education Spectrum moved its meetings to a co-working space in Pasadena. It wasn’t until July that the building was able to reopen, but that was after six months of disruption. The shift from a private space to a public one, was challenging for some clients, according to Education Spectrum executive director Nathan Roettger.</p>

                <p>“This is a place they can come and they really feel free to speak openly,” he said. “When we were meeting out within the community, you’re limited on how much you can still talk.”</p>

                <p>Disruptions in routine can have drastic effects on people with development disabilities, and in a disaster like this, can have devastating social and professional consequences. TKTK EXPERT ON THIS.</p>

                <p>“I showed up to work but wasn’t able to because of the fire,” said Laino, who works as a medical assistant at Comprehensive Community Health Centers. “I had an inability to talk to anyone, not even my coworkers.”</p>

                <p>Laino was able to take time off work, but not all people in his position would be granted that. A lot of people with developmental disabilities already face barriers securing employment, and extenuating circumstances can make those barriers even more difficult to face.</p>

                <p>“Our [clients] want to work,” said Roettger. “They really do. And they’re qualified. It’s just such a tough time.”</p>

                <p>The fires came just as Education Spectrum and its clients were adapting to the years-long hurdle caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

                <p>“There’s just been too much asked of them these last five years,” said Roettger.</p>
